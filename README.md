SC107 PROJECT :
We created a C program to determine the volume of tumor cells at any time t. We have taken time as an input to determine the volume.
We created source codes for 4 models: Exponential Model, Gompertz Model, Logistic model and Stochastic Gompertz model. We have also taken few parameters as input.
